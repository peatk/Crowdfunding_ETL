# Crowdfunding ETL


In my ETL mini project I constructed an ETL pipeline leveraging the power of Python and Pandas. My primary tools for extraction and transformation was Python dictionary methods, allowing me to efficiently manipulate the data. Once the transformation is complete, we'll generate four CSV files.

The subsequent steps involve utilizing the CSV file data to craft an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and design a comprehensive table schema. This process ensures a clear visualization of the data model we'll be working with, facilitating better understanding and organization.

Finally, the last phase involves uploading the CSV file data into a PostgreSQL database. This step is crucial for establishing a centralized and structured repository for our transformed data. Throughout this endeavor, I leveraged my skills in Python, Pandas, and database management to seamlessly navigate the ETL process and produce meaningful insights from the raw data.
